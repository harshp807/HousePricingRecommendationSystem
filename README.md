Data cleansing, pre-processing, analyzing, and model-training and building the prediction model are being done on jupyter notebook using Python libraries to make our recommendation model work more accurately. 

The frontend is built using the tech stack of HTML and Javascript
The backend is built completely using the libraries of Python
Frontend and backend are logically connected using the 'predict_api' API
The complete project is containerized using the docker. The project is 100% plug and play
